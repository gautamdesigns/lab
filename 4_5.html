          <p>Because of pollution, the Earth's ozone layer has suffered a lot. That's bad news for everyone since the fragile gas layer protects our planet and shields us from the Sun's harmful ultraviolet rays. Fortunately, climate change experts believe that the ozone layer will fully heal within 50 years,according to a 2018 report from the United Nations.
          </p>
          <p>The recovery is largely thanks to the Montreal Protocol of 1987, which put a global ban on using one of the main culprits for the damage: chlorofluorocarbons (CFOs).Previously, CFOs had been common in refrigerators, aerosol cans, and dry-cleaning chemicals.
