          <p>For simplicity’s sake, most of the more than 200 countries in the world use the metric system when describing things like length or mass. However, there were recently three countries that stood out:Liberia, Myanmar, and the United States.
          </p>
          <p>In 2018, Liberia Commerce and industry minister Wilson Tarpeh said the government planned to adopt the metric system in order to promote accountability and transparency in trade, according to the Liberian Observer.Myanmar made a similar commitment, which leaves the U.S. as the lone holdout. </p>
