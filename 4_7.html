          <p>Silence is golden, as they say. And while it may not be
            worth quite as much as jewels and gold to most people, it certainly
            was the primary goal for those who built the quietest room in
            the world. Located at Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond,
            Washington State, the lab room measures a background noise
            of -20.35 dBA, which is 20 decibels below the threshold of human
            hearing and breaking previous records for spaces that were
            deemed the planet's quietest places, according to CNN.
